## sass-brunch
Adds Sass support to
[brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Usage
Add `"sass-brunch": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.

Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your minor (y) brunch version.

If you want to use git version of plugin, add
`"sass-brunch": "git+ssh://git@github.com:brunch/sass-brunch.git"`.

### Options
Print line number references as comments instead of sass's default FireSass fake media query:
```
config:
  plugins:
    sass:
      debug: 'comments'
```
To include the source files' name/path in either debug mode, create a parent file that `@include` your actual sass/scss source. Make sure the source files are renamed to start with an underscore (`_file.scss`), or otherwise exclude them from the build so they don't get double-included.
